# Euroleague Shiny App

This repo includes some of the source code for the Euroleague Shiny Apps that I currently have:
[Team Stats App](https://hooplytics.shinyapps.io/EL_Team_Stats/) consist of team-level offense and defense stats with four tabs: Traditional, Advanced, Scoring, By Zone.

Glossary will be added soon.

## Tabs

### Traditional

Provides totals of traditional metrics such as points, assists etc. GP (games played) allows you to calculate *per game* stats easily.

### Advanced

Provides aggregated data over *possession importance*, which allows you to filter out *garbage time*, see which type of possessions teams drive their metrics from. Along with usual field goal percentages, advanced metrics are also included. Such as ORTG (offensive rating, per 75), TS_PCT (true shooting percentage), AST_PCT (assist per possession), TO_PCT (turnover per possession).

### Scoring

Provides aggregated data over *possession importance*, while providing additional information related to scoring such as percentage of fastbreaks, second chance, off turnover field goals.

### By Zone

Provides aggregated data over shot zones and shot areas.
